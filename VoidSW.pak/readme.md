## Installation

**Since VoidSW is a standalone app, it will NOT be auto-saved when you shut down your Mini,
you alone are responsible for saving progress!**

Save files are stored in `Tools/VoidSW.pak/`.


1. Download the latest version from Github: https://github.com/erazemk/MiniUI-Apps/releases
2. Extract the archive.
3. Copy the following files from the original game folder (i.e. from the GOG or Steam version) to the `VoidSW.pak` folder:

   - SW.GRP
   - SW.RTS 
   - optional: the .GRP of any additional mission pack (like Wanton Destruction)
   - optional: For the game to use CD music, place the "music" folder inside of this one. Make sure the tracks are named correctly (Track0X.ogg).


4. Move the `VoidSW.pak` directory to your SD card, to the `Tools` directory (create it if it doesn't exist already).

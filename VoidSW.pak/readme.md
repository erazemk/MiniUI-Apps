# MiniUI Apps - VoidSW

This is a port of Richard Gobeille's VoidSW (which in turn is based on eduke32), a wrapper for the game Shadow Warrior, repacked for MiniUI.

## Installation

**Since VoidSW is a standalone app, it will NOT be auto-saved when you shut down your Mini,
you alone are responsible for saving progress!**

Save files are stored in `Tools/VoidSW.pak/`.


### Copy the following files from the original game folder to the `VoidSW.pak` folder:

- SW.GRP
- SW.RTS 
- optional: the .GRP of any additional mission pack
- optional: For the game to use CD music, place the "music" folder inside of this one. Make sure the tracks are named correctly (Track0X.ogg).
